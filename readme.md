## Comments

The battle system is poorly programmed due to the lack of time. As a result, a
magic system hasn't been implamented yet, but I plan to release it after the
competition.

The game engine is very sleek and smooth, very customable: just change a few
variables, and you are ready to go with your own game.

This game is not a one man's project. Many developers and game artists had given
their hands with this production from the font tileset to the eyecandy graphics.
I thank all the developers and artists who dedicated their time to improve this
game and become what it is today.

You can save the game in emulators and in flashcarts. In flashcarts you will
need to patch the game with DLDI (most loaders do it automatically).
